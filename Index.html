				<h2><strong>Why Code Next?</strong></h2>
				<ol>
					<h3><li>You have a chance to learn</li></h3>
						<p>How often do you find spaces geared towards teaching code to children of color in order to diversify the tech world? At Code Next, we're not just learning how to be a coder. We're also learning how to be active members of our community and the ways in which we can be mentors to others just as our coaches are to us. To be apart of Code Next is a unique experience where I have an opportunity to not just develop coding skills, but also to learn more about the world around me and how I can help the causes that I most care about.</p>
					<h3><li>It's a lax environment</li></h3>	
						<p>I have to admit, the Saturdays are long and can be tiring. However, I really do believe that our coaches strive to make the Code Next lab a safe and relaxed environment for everyone. The coaches help us set goals for our code and are patient when we don't understand a topic. It is not as demanding and stressful as our daily lives at school. In addition, the coaches are availible to meet on most days during the school-week so that we may catch up on work or get reinforcement on the content we recently learned. </p>
					<h3><li>You get to make friends</li></h3>	
						<p>Since we're all working on the same projects and maybe struggling with the same code, I think we're bound to make friends. I like that the coaches sometimes create groups so that we may learn to work with new people. In addition, at the end of the term, we have "I appreciate" which is when we draw the name of a person from a hat and must tell them why we appreciated them and their work that semester. I go to an all-girls private school on the UES so finding friends apart from that life was really important to me. I genuinely believe that we can find friends in our coaches as well. </p>
